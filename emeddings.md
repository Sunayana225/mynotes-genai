# Embeddings

Embeddings are numerical representation of piece of text converted to number sequences.
Embeddings make it easy for computers to understand relationships between text.
Word embeddings capture properties of the word.
Actual embeddings represent more properties than just two.
These rows of coordinates are called vectors and represented as numbers. 
# Semantic similarity 
consine and dot product similarity can be used to compute numerical stability

## What is an API?

**API (Application Programming Interface)** is like a waiter in a restaurant. You (the client) tell the waiter what you want, the waiter takes your order to the kitchen (the server), and brings back your food (the response).

APIs let different software applications talk to each other and exchange data.

---

## Request-Response Protocols

These work like a conversation: you ask a question, you get an answer.

### REST (Representational State Transfer)

**What it is:** The most popular way to build web APIs today. Think of it as using the web the way it was designed to work.

**How it works:**
- Uses standard HTTP methods:
  - **GET** - Retrieve data (like reading a book)
  - **POST** - Create new data (like adding a book to shelf)
  - **PUT** - Update existing data (like editing a book)
  - **DELETE** - Remove data (like removing a book)
- Data usually sent as JSON (easy-to-read text format)
- Each resource has its own URL (e.g., `/users/123`, `/products/456`)

**Key Features:**
- Stateless (each request is independent, server doesn't remember you)
- Cacheable (responses can be saved for faster access)
- Uses standard HTTP status codes (200 = success, 404 = not found, 500 = server error)

**When to use:**
- Building web applications
- Mobile apps connecting to servers
- Public APIs for third-party developers
- When you need simplicity and wide support

**Example:**
```
GET https://api.example.com/users/123
Response: {"id": 123, "name": "John", "email": "john@example.com"}
```

**Pros:** Simple, flexible, widely understood, great documentation
**Cons:** Can require multiple requests for complex data, no built-in real-time support

---

### SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)

**What it is:** An older, more formal protocol that's very strict about structure. Think of it as sending official letters with specific formatting rules.

**How it works:**
- Uses XML (a verbose, tag-based format)
- Has built-in standards for security, transactions, and error handling
- Requires a WSDL file (a contract describing what the API can do)
- Can work over HTTP, SMTP, or other protocols

**Key Features:**
- Strong typing (data types are strictly defined)
- Built-in security standards (WS-Security)
- ACID compliance for transactions
- Language and platform independent

**When to use:**
- Enterprise applications (banking, healthcare)
- When you need guaranteed message delivery
- High-security requirements
- Legacy systems integration

**Example:**
```xml
<soap:Envelope>
  <soap:Body>
    <GetUser>
      <UserId>123</UserId>
    </GetUser>
  </soap:Body>
</soap:Envelope>
```

**Pros:** Very secure, reliable, built-in error handling, works well in enterprise
**Cons:** Complex, verbose, slower than REST, harder to learn

---

### GraphQL

**What it is:** A modern query language that lets clients ask for exactly the data they need. It's like ordering a custom meal instead of choosing from a fixed menu.

**How it works:**
- Single endpoint (usually `/graphql`)
- Client specifies exactly what fields they want
- Server responds with only that data
- Strongly typed schema defines available data

**Key Features:**
- No over-fetching (getting too much data)
- No under-fetching (needing multiple requests)
- Self-documenting (schema describes everything)
- Supports real-time updates via subscriptions

**When to use:**
- Complex data requirements
- Mobile apps with limited bandwidth
- When frontend and backend teams work separately
- Applications needing flexible data fetching

**Example:**
```graphql
query {
  user(id: 123) {
    name
    email
    posts {
      title
    }
  }
}
```

**Pros:** Flexible, efficient, reduces requests, great for complex UIs
**Cons:** More complex to set up, can be harder to cache, potential for expensive queries

---

### JSON-RPC / XML-RPC

**What it is:** Simple protocols for calling functions on a remote server. Like calling a function in your code, but the function runs on another computer.

**How it works:**
- Send a function name and parameters
- Server executes the function
- Returns the result
- Very lightweight and straightforward

**When to use:**
- Simple internal APIs
- When you just need to call remote functions
- Microservices communication

**Example (JSON-RPC):**
```json
Request: {"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "getUser", "params": [123], "id": 1}
Response: {"jsonrpc": "2.0", "result": {"name": "John"}, "id": 1}
```

**Pros:** Very simple, lightweight, easy to understand
**Cons:** Less standardized than REST, fewer features

---

## Real-Time Communication

These protocols enable instant, live updates without refreshing or polling.

### WebSocket

**What it is:** A persistent, two-way connection between client and server. Like keeping a phone call open instead of hanging up and calling back repeatedly.

**How it works:**
- Starts as a regular HTTP connection
- "Upgrades" to WebSocket protocol
- Keeps connection open for bidirectional communication
- Both client and server can send messages anytime

**Key Features:**
- Full-duplex (both sides can talk simultaneously)
- Low latency (instant communication)
- Persistent connection
- Works through firewalls (starts as HTTP)

**When to use:**
- Chat applications
- Live notifications
- Multiplayer games
- Collaborative editing tools
- Live sports scores
- Trading platforms

**Example flow:**
```
1. Client: "Upgrade to WebSocket"
2. Server: "OK, upgraded"
3. Client → Server: "Hello!"
4. Server → Client: "Hi there!"
5. Server → Client: "New message arrived"
```

**Pros:** Real-time, efficient, bidirectional, low latency
**Cons:** More complex than HTTP, requires special server setup, connection can drop

---

### SSE (Server-Sent Events)

**What it is:** One-way communication where the server pushes updates to the client. Like subscribing to a news feed that automatically sends you updates.

**How it works:**
- Client opens a connection to server
- Server keeps sending updates over time
- Built on standard HTTP
- Automatic reconnection if connection drops

**Key Features:**
- One direction only (server to client)
- Built-in reconnection
- Simple to implement
- Works with existing HTTP infrastructure

**When to use:**
- Live news feeds
- Stock price updates
- Social media notifications
- Server status monitoring
- When you only need server-to-client updates

**Example:**
```javascript
const eventSource = new EventSource('/api/updates');
eventSource.onmessage = (event) => {
  console.log('New update:', event.data);
};
```

**Pros:** Simple, built into browsers, automatic reconnection, works with HTTP
**Cons:** One-way only, limited browser support for custom headers

---

### Webhooks

**What it is:** Automated notifications sent from one system to another when something happens. Like setting up a doorbell notification on your phone.

**How it works:**
- You register a URL with a service
- When an event happens, the service sends an HTTP POST to your URL
- Your server receives and processes the notification
- One-time notification per event

**Key Features:**
- Event-driven (triggered by actions)
- Push-based (you don't ask, they tell you)
- Simple HTTP POST requests
- No constant polling needed

**When to use:**
- Payment notifications (Stripe, PayPal)
- GitHub repository events
- Form submissions
- Order status updates
- Any event-based notifications

**Example:**
```
Event: New payment received
Webhook sends POST to: https://yourapp.com/webhook/payment
Payload: {"event": "payment.success", "amount": 100, "user_id": 123}
```

**Pros:** Simple, efficient, no polling, real-time, reduces server load
**Cons:** Requires publicly accessible URL, no built-in retry logic, security considerations

---

### WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication)

**What it is:** Peer-to-peer communication directly between browsers. Like two people talking directly without a middleman.

**How it works:**
- Establishes direct connection between peers
- Can transfer audio, video, or data
- Uses STUN/TURN servers for initial connection
- No server in the middle (after setup)

**When to use:**
- Video calling (Zoom, Google Meet)
- Voice calls
- Screen sharing
- File sharing between browsers
- Online gaming

**Pros:** Low latency, high quality, direct peer connection, no server bandwidth needed
**Cons:** Complex setup, NAT traversal issues, browser compatibility

---

## Messaging Protocols

These protocols are designed for reliable message delivery in distributed systems.

### gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call)

**What it is:** A modern, high-performance framework for calling functions on remote servers. Like REST but much faster and more efficient.

**How it works:**
- Uses HTTP/2 for transport (faster than HTTP/1.1)
- Protocol Buffers for serialization (compact binary format)
- Generates client and server code automatically
- Supports four types of communication

**Communication Types:**
1. **Unary** - Single request, single response (like REST)
2. **Server streaming** - Single request, multiple responses
3. **Client streaming** - Multiple requests, single response
4. **Bidirectional streaming** - Both sides stream messages

**Key Features:**
- Very fast (binary protocol)
- Strongly typed (using .proto files)
- Built-in code generation
- Works across multiple languages
- Supports authentication, load balancing, and more

**When to use:**
- Microservices communication
- High-performance APIs
- Internal APIs (not public-facing)
- Mobile apps (efficient bandwidth use)
- Real-time streaming data

**Example (.proto file):**
```protobuf
service UserService {
  rpc GetUser (UserRequest) returns (UserResponse);
  rpc ListUsers (Empty) returns (stream UserResponse);
}
```

**Pros:** Very fast, efficient, strongly typed, great tooling, supports streaming
**Cons:** Not human-readable, harder to debug, limited browser support, steeper learning curve

---

### MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport)

**What it is:** A lightweight messaging protocol designed for devices with limited power and bandwidth. Like a highly efficient postal service for machines.

**How it works:**
- Publish-subscribe model
- Clients publish messages to topics
- Other clients subscribe to topics they're interested in
- Broker (server) handles message routing
- Very small packet size

**Quality of Service (QoS) Levels:**
- **QoS 0** - Fire and forget (may lose messages)
- **QoS 1** - At least once delivery (may duplicate)
- **QoS 2** - Exactly once delivery (guaranteed)

**Key Features:**
- Extremely lightweight
- Topic-based routing (e.g., `home/bedroom/temperature`)
- Last Will & Testament (notify if device disconnects)
- Retained messages (new subscribers get last message)

**When to use:**
- IoT devices (sensors, smart home)
- Mobile apps with poor connectivity
- Low-bandwidth scenarios
- Battery-powered devices
- Large-scale device networks

**Example:**
```
Publisher → Broker: topic="home/temp", message="25°C"
Broker → Subscribers: All devices subscribed to "home/temp" receive "25°C"
```

**Pros:** Very lightweight, reliable, designed for IoT, low power consumption, scales well
**Cons:** Not designed for large payloads, requires broker, not for request-response patterns

---

### AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol)

**What it is:** An enterprise-grade messaging protocol for reliable message delivery. Like a sophisticated postal system with guaranteed delivery, sorting, and routing.

**How it works:**
- Producers send messages to exchanges
- Exchanges route messages to queues based on rules
- Consumers receive messages from queues
- Acknowledgments ensure reliable delivery

**Key Components:**
- **Exchange** - Receives messages and routes them
- **Queue** - Stores messages until consumed
- **Binding** - Rules connecting exchanges to queues
- **Message** - The data being sent

**Exchange Types:**
- **Direct** - Routes to queue with exact routing key
- **Topic** - Routes based on pattern matching
- **Fanout** - Broadcasts to all queues
- **Headers** - Routes based on message headers

**When to use:**
- Enterprise messaging systems
- Financial transactions
- Order processing systems
- When guaranteed delivery is critical
- Complex routing requirements

**Example flow:**
```
1. Producer → Exchange: "new.order" with order data
2. Exchange → Queue(s): Routes based on rules
3. Consumer ← Queue: Receives and processes order
4. Consumer → Queue: Acknowledges receipt
```

**Pros:** Very reliable, supports complex routing, standardized, language-agnostic, great for enterprise
**Cons:** Complex, heavier than MQTT, steeper learning curve

---

### STOMP (Simple Text Oriented Messaging Protocol)

**What it is:** A simple, text-based messaging protocol that's easy to implement. Like MQTT but human-readable.

**When to use:**
- When you need simple messaging
- Works well with WebSocket
- Message brokers (RabbitMQ, ActiveMQ)

**Pros:** Simple, text-based, easy to debug
**Cons:** Less efficient than binary protocols

---

## Architectural Patterns

### EDA (Event-Driven Architecture)

**What it is:** An architectural pattern where components communicate by producing and consuming events. Like a notification system where parts of your app react to things happening.

**How it works:**
- Components emit events when something happens
- Other components listen for events they care about
- No direct connection between components
- Asynchronous by nature

**Key Concepts:**
- **Event** - Something that happened (e.g., "Order Placed")
- **Event Producer** - Creates events
- **Event Consumer** - Reacts to events
- **Event Bus/Broker** - Delivers events

**When to use:**
- Microservices architecture
- Real-time systems
- When components should be loosely coupled
- Scalable systems
- Complex workflows

**Example:**
```
User places order → "OrderPlaced" event
  → Inventory Service (reduce stock)
  → Email Service (send confirmation)
  → Analytics Service (record sale)
  → Shipping Service (prepare shipment)
```

**Pros:** Loose coupling, highly scalable, flexible, easy to add new features
**Cons:** Harder to debug, eventual consistency, more complex architecture

---

### EDI (Electronic Data Interchange)

**What it is:** A standardized format for exchanging business documents between companies. Like a universal language for business paperwork.

**How it works:**
- Companies agree on a standard format
- Documents (invoices, orders, etc.) converted to EDI format
- Sent directly between systems
- Eliminates manual data entry

**Common Standards:**
- **ANSI X12** - North American standard
- **EDIFACT** - International standard
- **XML/EDI** - Modern XML-based version

**When to use:**
- B2B (Business-to-Business) transactions
- Supply chain management
- Healthcare claims
- Retail purchase orders
- Shipping documents

**Example Document Types:**
- 850 - Purchase Order
- 810 - Invoice
- 856 - Advance Ship Notice

**Pros:** Reduces errors, speeds up processing, standardized, widely adopted in business
**Cons:** Complex to set up, requires translation software, legacy technology

---

### OData (Open Data Protocol)

**What it is:** A REST-based protocol with standardized ways to query and manipulate data. Like REST with extra superpowers.

**Key Features:**
- URL-based queries with filters, sorting, pagination
- Standard query syntax
- Metadata describing the API
- JSON or XML format

**When to use:**
- When you need complex querying
- Microsoft ecosystem
- Data-heavy applications

---

### Long Polling & Comet

**What it is:** Techniques for getting real-time updates before WebSocket existed.

**Long Polling:**
- Client requests data
- Server holds request until new data available
- Server responds, client immediately requests again
- Like repeatedly asking "Are we there yet?" on a road trip

**Comet:**
- Umbrella term for server push techniques
- Includes long polling and other methods

**When to use:**
- Legacy browser support
- When WebSocket isn't available
- Fallback mechanism

**Pros:** Works with old browsers, simple concept
**Cons:** Inefficient, higher latency than WebSocket, more server resources

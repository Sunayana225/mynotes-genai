# AI Agents and Autonomous Systems

## What are AI Agents?

**Definition:**
AI systems that can perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions autonomously to achieve specific goals.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Autonomy**: Operate without constant human intervention
- **Reactivity**: Respond to environmental changes
- **Proactivity**: Take initiative to achieve goals
- **Social ability**: Interact with other agents or humans

## Agent Architecture Components

### 1. Perception

**What it does:**
- Receives input from environment
- Processes sensor data
- Understands current state

**Examples:**
- Text input from users
- API responses
- Database queries
- File system access

### 2. Reasoning/Planning

**What it does:**
- Analyzes current state
- Determines next actions
- Creates action plans
- Evaluates options

**Techniques:**
- Chain-of-thought reasoning
- Tree of Thoughts
- ReAct (Reasoning + Acting)
- Plan-and-Execute

### 3. Action/Execution

**What it does:**
- Executes planned actions
- Uses tools and APIs
- Modifies environment
- Generates outputs

**Common Actions:**
- Call APIs
- Query databases
- Write files
- Send emails
- Run code
- Make calculations

### 4. Memory

**Types:**

**Short-term Memory:**
- Current conversation context
- Immediate task information
- Working memory buffer
- Limited capacity

**Long-term Memory:**
- Historical interactions
- Learned knowledge
- User preferences
- Vector database storage

**Episodic Memory:**
- Past experiences
- Action outcomes
- Success/failure records
- Learning from mistakes
